### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on these three projects:

 (1) **Python Replication: WRDS Financial Ratios**

Status: Awaiting publication

The financial_ratio_python consists of Python files designed to replicate the calculation of [Financial Ratios at the Firm Level WRDS (Beta)](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/get-data/financial-ratios-suite-wrds/financial-ratios/financial-ratios-firm-level-by-wrds-beta/)
 
 (2) **Sample Code for Tracking Disclosure Change Trajectories for Financial Fraud Detection**

Status: Awaiting publication

This repository has the code we employed for the "Tracking Disclosure Change Trajectories for Financial Fraud Detection" project. Due to data permissions, I'm only able to share code associated with pivotal steps such as paragraph matching, building change metrics, and deep learning model implementations, among others.
     
 (3) **Sample Code for  More than Words: Quantifying Skepticism Toward Firmâ€™s Fundamentals**

      Status: Awaiting publication. 

      This repository holds the code from our project titled "More than Words: Quantifying Skepticism Toward Firmâ€™s Fundamentals." Given data permissions, I've made available code relevant to critical phases: deploying deep learning models for skepticism quantification, extracting linguistic features, and more.
